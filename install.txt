# üîê Security Policy

## üìò Overview

This repository contains code written in **TypeScript (Node.js)** and **C# (.NET)**. This policy outlines our approach to keeping it secure through secure development practices, CI/CD controls, dependency hygiene, and vulnerability reporting.

---

## üéØ Scope

This policy applies to:

- All application and infrastructure code in this repository
- Build scripts, CI/CD pipelines, and related artifacts
- Contributors, maintainers, and DevOps engineers

---

## ‚úÖ Secure Coding Practices

### For All Code

- Follow [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Avoid hardcoding secrets, credentials, or tokens
- Apply the **principle of least privilege** for all configuration and code

### TypeScript

- Use `eslint` with `eslint-plugin-security` to catch insecure patterns
- Use strict types and avoid `any` where possible
- Avoid unsafe usage of `eval()`, `Function()`, or dynamic imports
- Avoid directly accessing external input in DB or command-line operations

### C#

- Use input validation libraries like `FluentValidation`
- Protect against SQL injection with parameterized queries (e.g., `SqlCommand.Parameters`)
- Use `HttpClientFactory` for safe HTTP calls (avoid raw `HttpClient` reuse)
- Use strong typing and nullability features
- Avoid reflection and unsafe code blocks unless justified

---

## üîê Secrets Management

- Do not store secrets, credentials, or tokens in source files
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude:
  - `.env`, `appsettings.Development.json`, `secrets.json`
- Secrets should be managed via:
  - Environment variables
  - GitHub/GitLab CI/CD secrets
  - Vault services (e.g., Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

Tools used:
- GitLab Secret Detection
- GitGuardian (optional)
- Pre-commit hooks with `detect-secrets`

---

## üì¶ Dependency Management

### TypeScript (Node.js)

- All packages must be declared in `package.json`
- Run `npm audit` or integrate [GitLab Dependency Scanning](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/)
- Detect unused/missing packages using `depcheck`
- Detect unmaintained packages via custom scripts or `npm-check-updates`

### C# (.NET)

- All dependencies must be declared in `.csproj` or `packages.config`
- Use `dotnet list package --vulnerable` or [OWASP Dependency-Check](https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/)
- Pin versions and avoid transitive bloat
- Use only packages with active support and security posture

---

## üß™ Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

- Enable SAST scans in CI for both languages:
  - TypeScript: ESLint + GitLab/GitHub SAST
  - C#: Roslyn analyzers, SonarQube, or GitLab SAST
- Critical/High severity issues must block merge unless a documented exception exists

---

## üß™ Additional Scans

- **Secret detection** is required in CI for every merge request
- **Container scanning** (if Dockerized) must run on all tagged builds
- **DAST** scans are optional but encouraged for exposed web services

---

## üõ°Ô∏è CI/CD Security Controls

- CI pipelines must run:
  - SAST
  - Dependency scanning
  - Secret scanning
- Pipelines must fail if:
  - Secrets are committed
  - Critical/High vulnerabilities are detected
- Build containers must be pulled from trusted registries and scanned

---

## üîç Code Review & Branch Protection

- Require at least **one reviewer** for all MRs/PRs
- Reviewers must validate:
  - Input sanitization
  - Secure use of third-party libraries
  - No secrets or sensitive keys in changes
- Enforce branch protections:
  - No force pushes to `main`, `release/*`
  - Require status checks to pass before merge

---

## üîê Repository Access Control

- Enforce 2FA for all contributors
- Use least privilege for repo permissions (Developer vs Maintainer roles)
- Rotate personal access tokens and CI/CD credentials regularly
- Audit repository access quarterly

---

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, report it confidentially:

- Email: `security@example.com`
- Do **not** open public issues for vulnerabilities

We will:

- Acknowledge your report within 72 hours
- Provide a fix or mitigation within 14 days (target SLA)

---

## üìÖ Maintenance

- All dependencies must be reviewed for security updates monthly
- Security tools and CI scripts are updated quarterly
- This policy is reviewed and updated every 6 months

---

## üôè Acknowledgements

- OWASP Foundation
- GitLab Secure / GitHub Security
- Node.js Security WG
- Microsoft Secure Dev Practices

üõ† Step-by-Step OpenSSL Commands
üîπ Step 1: Generate Root CA

mkdir -p certs/root
cd certs/root

# Generate Root CA private key
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 4096

# Generate Root CA self-signed certificate (valid 10 years)
openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key ca.key -sha256 -days 3650 \
  -out ca.crt -subj "/C=US/ST=CA/O=MyRootCA/CN=MyRootCA"

üî∏ Step 2: Generate Intermediate CA

cd ../intermediate

# Generate Intermediate CA private key
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 4096

# Generate CSR for Intermediate CA
openssl req -new -key ca.key -out ca.csr -subj "/C=US/ST=CA/O=MyIntermediateCA/CN=MyIntermediateCA"

# Sign intermediate CSR with Root CA
openssl x509 -req -in ca.csr -CA ../root/ca.crt -CAkey ../root/ca.key -CAcreateserial \
  -out ca.crt -days 1825 -sha256

üîπ Step 3: Generate and Sign Client Certificate

cd ../clients

# Generate private key for client
openssl genrsa -out MyClient.key 2048

# Create CSR for client cert
openssl req -new -key MyClient.key -out MyClient.csr -subj "/CN=MyClient"

# Sign client CSR with Intermediate CA
openssl x509 -req -in MyClient.csr \
  -CA ../intermediate/ca.crt -CAkey ../intermediate/ca.key -CAcreateserial \
  -out MyClient.crt -days 365 -sha256

üîê Step 4: Bundle into PFX (PKCS#12)

# Combine full chain: Intermediate + Root
cat ../intermediate/ca.crt ../root/ca.crt > full_chain.crt

# Export client cert, private key, and chain to PFX
openssl pkcs12 -export \
  -out MyClient.pfx \
  -inkey MyClient.key \
  -in MyClient.crt \
  -certfile full_chain.crt \
  -name "MyClient"


var certCollection = new X509Certificate2Collection();

            Console.WriteLine("No certificate with private key found in the PFX.");
            return;
        }

        // Build the chain
        var chain = new X509Chain();
        chain.ChainPolicy.ExtraStore.AddRange(certCollection);
        chain.ChainPolicy.RevocationMode = X509RevocationMode.NoCheck;

        bool isValid = chain.Build(leafCert);
        Console.WriteLine($"Chain is valid: {isValid}");

        // Print the chain
        Console.WriteLine("Chain elements:");
        foreach (var element in chain.ChainElements)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Subject: {element.Certificate.Subject}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Issuer : {element.Certificate.Issuer}");

            if (element.Certificate.Subject == element.Certificate.Issuer)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("This is a ROOT CA.");
            }

            Console.WriteLine();
        }




public static List<X509Certificate2> LoadPemCertificates(string pemPath)
    {
        string pemContent = File.ReadAllText(pemPath);
        var certificates = new List<X509Certificate2>();

        var matches = Regex.Matches(pemContent, "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----(.*?)-----END CERTIFICATE-----", RegexOptions.Singleline);

        foreach (Match match in matches)
        {
            string base64 = match.Groups[1].Value.Replace("\r", "").Replace("\n", "");
            byte[] certBytes = Convert.FromBase64String(base64);
            var cert = new X509Certificate2(certBytes);
            certificates.Add(cert);
        }

        return certificates;
    }

To conduct a productive Iterative Threat Modeling session with your software development team, you can follow a structured, collaborative, and repeatable approach. Here's a clear guide on how to plan and conduct the meeting, along with tools and templates you can use:
üß† Purpose of the Meeting

    Identify, assess, and prioritize threats early and throughout the development lifecycle.

    Build a shared security mindset among developers, testers, and architects.

    Integrate threat modeling into your agile/DevOps iterations.

‚úÖ Pre-Meeting Preparation

    Choose a system or feature to model
    Select a user story, epic, feature, or microservice that is being built or changed.

    Invite key roles
    Include developers, product owner, QA, security engineer, and architect if available.

    Prepare visuals
    Create or update data flow diagrams (DFD), architecture diagrams, or sequence diagrams.

    Select a framework
    Choose a threat modeling framework (recommendations below).

üõ†Ô∏è Common Threat Modeling Frameworks

    STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege)

    PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)

    Kill Chain / MITRE ATT&CK

    LINDDUN (for privacy-focused systems)

    For Dev teams, STRIDE + Agile stories + DFDs is often the most approachable.

üìã Meeting Agenda (60‚Äì90 minutes)
1. [5‚Äì10 min] Set Context

    Scope the session: what feature/system are we modeling?

    Recap recent changes or planned development.

2. [10‚Äì15 min] Describe the System

    Walk through the architecture/DFD.

    Explain key components, data stores, actors, and trust boundaries.

3. [25‚Äì30 min] Identify Threats

Use STRIDE per element:
Element	Example STRIDE threats
External user	Spoofing, Repudiation
Database	Tampering, Info Disclosure
API	DoS, Tampering, Elevation of Privilege

Encourage participants to think through:

    What can go wrong?

    How can an attacker abuse this?

    Where are the weak points?

You can use checklists or a Threat Modeling card deck to inspire ideas.
4. [15‚Äì20 min] Prioritize Threats

Use criteria such as:

    Likelihood √ó Impact

    Is there a mitigation already in place?

    Is this a blocker for release?

Use a matrix like:

| Threat                 | Severity | Mitigation Owner | Sprint? |
|------------------------|----------|------------------|---------|
| API token leakage      | High     | Dev Lead         | Sprint 22 |
| DB privilege escalation| Medium   | Security         | Backlog |

5. [5‚Äì10 min] Define Actions

    Assign mitigation actions.

    Add tasks or stories to your backlog.

    Set follow-up if threat needs deeper review.

üß∞ Tools You Can Use

    Draw.io, Miro, or Lucidchart for diagramming

    Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool (for STRIDE-focused analysis)

    OWASP Threat Dragon (open-source)

    Jira / Azure DevOps to track threat mitigations

üîÅ Iterative Approach Tips

    Run a session every sprint, or at least for every new feature or significant change.

    Keep each session short and focused.

    Track outcomes and review previous threats to ensure they were addressed.

    Celebrate when teams eliminate or block real risks!

üìÑ Example Follow-up Artifacts

    Updated DFD

    Threat table with risks and owners

    Jira tickets for mitigations

So in this case, lets focus on backend changes, what are some of the possible ways to review threats related to spoofing and its mitigating controls 
ChatGPT said:

Focusing on backend changes‚Äîlet‚Äôs drill into Spoofing threats and how to review and mitigate them effectively during your threat modeling or code review process.
üîç What is Spoofing (STRIDE)?

Spoofing refers to an attacker pretending to be someone (or something) they‚Äôre not, typically to gain unauthorized access.

In backend systems (especially .NET APIs), spoofing targets authentication, identity assertion, or trust boundaries.
üîß Backend Threat Review ‚Äì Spoofing Focus
üîÅ Step-by-Step Threat Review Process
Step	What to Review	Tools / Techniques
1Ô∏è‚É£	Authentication flow	Review how tokens/credentials are issued and validated
2Ô∏è‚É£	Entry points	Identify all APIs that require identity validation
3Ô∏è‚É£	Trust assumptions	Verify what the backend trusts from frontend, headers, tokens
4Ô∏è‚É£	Token validation logic	Inspect JWT parsing and verification code
5Ô∏è‚É£	External integration points	Check SSO, OAuth, or identity providers for proper validation
6Ô∏è‚É£	Logs and traceability	Ensure failed/successful auth attempts are logged
üß® Common Backend Spoofing Threats + Controls
#	Threat	How It Happens	‚úÖ Mitigating Controls
1	Forged JWT	Attacker crafts a fake token (e.g., with a known key or none)	üîê Validate JWT signature, issuer (iss), audience (aud), expiration (exp), and alg (use HS256/RS256 appropriately)
2	Token with elevated claims	Adds "role": "admin" to token payload	üîê Never trust token claims blindly; verify user privileges server-side from DB if needed
3	Replay of stolen token	Token intercepted or reused	‚è≥ Use short-lived tokens, rotate refresh tokens, and monitor reuse
4	Trusting client headers (e.g., X-UserId)	Attacker adds spoofed headers in request	‚ùå Never trust user identity from headers; derive identity from token only
5	Lack of [Authorize] on API endpoints	Sensitive endpoint accessible without auth	üîí Use [Authorize] and [Authorize(Roles = "...")] attributes appropriately
6	Improper OAuth / SSO flow	Backend trusts user identity without verifying access token	üîê Validate access tokens with identity provider (e.g., Okta, Azure AD)
7	Credential stuffing	Reuse of known username/password combos	üß± Enable rate-limiting, CAPTCHA, and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
8	Shared API keys	API key reused or leaked	üîë Prefer OAuth2 tokens over API keys; rotate keys; scope API keys tightly
‚úÖ Best Practices & Defensive Controls
Area	Recommendation
üîê Authentication	Use standards like OAuth2, OIDC, SAML
üïµÔ∏è Token Validation	Use libraries like Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens or System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt
üß≠ Claims Handling	Don‚Äôt trust claims from token for critical authorization decisions‚Äîverify from backend or user DB
üß± Access Control	Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) at API level
üìú Logging	Log failed logins, invalid tokens, and suspicious login patterns
üìâ Monitoring	Alert on token anomalies (e.g., tokens from new geo/IP locations)
üåê TLS Everywhere	Enforce HTTPS and HSTS to prevent token interception
üîç Code Review Checklist for Spoofing
‚úÖ	Check
üîí	Is [Authorize] applied to every sensitive API?
üîë	Are JWTs validated for signature, issuer, audience, expiration?
‚ùå	Is any part of user identity coming from request headers or body?
üõÇ	Are roles/claims validated before privileged actions?
‚è≥	Are tokens time-bound and revocable?
üßæ	Are login attempts, auth failures, and token reuse logged?

Would you like a review checklist or PowerPoint version of this for team walkthroughs or security reviews?

So in this case, lets focus on backend changes, what are some of the possible ways to review threats related to Tampering and its mitigating controls 
ChatGPT said:

Great ‚Äî let's focus on Tampering threats in the backend (e.g., .NET APIs) and how to review them during code reviews, threat modeling, or security assessments.
üõ† STRIDE Category: Tampering (Backend-Focused)
üéØ What is Tampering?

    Tampering involves unauthorized modification of data, requests, or system behavior ‚Äî either in transit, at rest, or within application logic.

üîÅ Threat Review Approach for Tampering
Step	Review Target	What to Ask
1Ô∏è‚É£	API inputs (query, path, body)	Can inputs be altered to access or modify unintended data?
2Ô∏è‚É£	Headers and cookies	Are any security decisions made based on modifiable headers?
3Ô∏è‚É£	Database operations	Are user inputs used in SQL queries without proper handling?
4Ô∏è‚É£	Object deserialization	Can attacker manipulate serialized payloads?
5Ô∏è‚É£	Trust boundaries	Are you trusting unverified data from clients or third parties?
üß® Backend Tampering Threats + Mitigating Controls
#	Threat	How It Happens	‚úÖ Mitigation
1	Parameter tampering	Attacker changes userId in request (PUT /users/2) to modify someone else‚Äôs data	üîí Validate object ownership on server (e.g., user.Id == request.UserId)
2	Query string tampering	Changes filters, paging, or internal flags (e.g., ?admin=true)	üîê Never expose sensitive query flags; re-check roles/permissions server-side
3	Header tampering	Spoofs X-UserId, X-Role headers if backend trusts them	‚ùå Never trust identity-related headers from client unless added by trusted proxy
4	Cookie tampering	Modifies client-side cookies to elevate access	üîê Use signed & encrypted cookies or HttpOnly/Secure cookies
5	SQL Injection	Injects SQL via raw inputs	‚úÖ Use parameterized queries or ORM (e.g., Entity Framework)
6	JSON/XML tampering	Alters payload schema or adds malicious fields	‚úÖ Use strict JSON schema validation; reject unknown fields
7	Deserialization attacks	Sends crafted serialized objects to exploit backend logic	üîê Avoid insecure deserialization (e.g., BinaryFormatter); whitelist allowed types
8	Tampering with config via env vars or headers	Overrides behavior via unsafe config mechanisms	üîí Validate critical config sources; restrict environment overrides in production
9	File path manipulation	Uploads file with ../../../ to access server paths	‚úÖ Sanitize and validate file paths and names; use path restrictions
‚úÖ Mitigating Controls by Layer
Layer	Control
API Layer	- Validate all inputs (length, format, type)
- Use model binding validation attributes (e.g., [Required], [Range])
Authorization Layer	- Enforce object/resource ownership
- Never rely on client input for role/privilege decisions
Data Access Layer	- Use parameterized queries
- Avoid building SQL via string concatenation
Serialization/Deserialization	- Use JSON schema validation
- Avoid insecure deserializers
Infrastructure/Headers	- Ignore untrusted headers unless from verified proxy
- Use reverse proxies to strip/add only safe headers
Files	- Sanitize filenames
- Restrict uploads to known paths
- Limit file types and extensions
üîç Code Review Checklist for Tampering

Focusing on backend changes and the Repudiation category of STRIDE, here‚Äôs how you can review related threats and apply mitigating controls.
üîç What is Repudiation?

Repudiation occurs when an attacker or user denies performing an action, and the system lacks sufficient evidence to prove otherwise. This impacts accountability and non-repudiation.
üîÅ Reviewing Repudiation Threats in Backend
Step	What to Review	Details
1Ô∏è‚É£	Audit Logging	Are all sensitive or critical actions logged with user ID, timestamp, and context?
2Ô∏è‚É£	Log Integrity	Are logs protected from tampering or unauthorized deletion?
3Ô∏è‚É£	Traceability	Can you trace an action back to a specific authenticated user or system?
4Ô∏è‚É£	Authentication Coverage	Are all endpoints requiring authentication to avoid anonymous actions?
5Ô∏è‚É£	Log Access Controls	Who can view or modify logs? Are logs centralized and access-restricted?
üß® Common Repudiation Threats + Controls
#	Threat	How It Happens	‚úÖ Mitigating Controls
1	Missing audit logs	No record of who performed sensitive actions (e.g., data modification)	‚úÖ Implement detailed audit logs with user identity, IP, timestamp, action details
2	Logs can be altered or deleted	Attackers or insiders modify logs to hide activity	‚úÖ Use append-only logging, write-once storage, or centralized logging services
3	Anonymous or unauthenticated actions	Critical operations allowed without login or token	‚úÖ Require authentication on all sensitive endpoints
4	Lack of correlation IDs	Cannot tie logs and requests across microservices	‚úÖ Use correlation IDs in request headers to trace activities end-to-end
5	Poor log retention or backup	Logs lost or unavailable during investigations	‚úÖ Enforce log retention policies and offsite backups
6	No alerting on suspicious activities	Suspicious actions go unnoticed	‚úÖ Implement anomaly detection and alerting on unusual log patterns
‚úÖ Repudiation Best Practices

I have .net background job running inside AWS ECS and connecting to Aurora Postgresql by using IAM authentications. I have observed that whenever job triggered it always uses the connection string which it got at the time of initialization of application. Since due to IAM authentication, the token is expiring after every 15 minutes so the job is not able to perform database operation after the token get expired. What could be issue?
ChatGPT said:

You're running into a common issue when using IAM-based authentication for Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL: the temporary authentication token used for database connections expires after 15 minutes, but your .NET background job is reusing a stale connection string or connection pool that still holds the expired token.
üß® Problem Breakdown:

    You generate a tokenized connection string at app startup.

    This token is valid for 15 minutes.

    Your background job uses this initial connection string/token.

    After 15 minutes, the token expires and any new connection attempt using it fails.

‚úÖ Root Cause:

.NET (and most other runtimes) caches and pools database connections by default using Npgsql (the .NET PostgreSQL driver). This means:

    If the connection string is reused and contains an expired token, pooled connections using that string will fail.

    If the connection string doesn‚Äôt change (e.g., same host, user, token), then Npgsql will recycle old connections, unaware that the token has expired.

‚úÖ Solution:

You need to dynamically regenerate the IAM token and recreate the Npgsql connection each time before performing any DB operation in the job.
üîß Recommended Fix (Code Example):

Here‚Äôs a pattern you can use:

using Amazon.RDS.Util;
using Npgsql;

public async Task ExecuteJobAsync()
{
    var token = RDSAuthTokenGenerator.GenerateAuthToken(
        region: "us-west-2",          // Replace with your region
        endpoint: "your-db-host",     // Aurora cluster endpoint
        port: 5432,
        username: "your-db-user"
    );

    var connString = new NpgsqlConnectionStringBuilder
    {
        Host = "your-db-host",
        Port = 5432,
        Username = "your-db-user",
        Password = token,
        Database = "your-db-name",
        SslMode = SslMode.Require,
        TrustServerCertificate = true
    }.ToString();

    using var conn = new NpgsqlConnection(connString);
    await conn.OpenAsync();

    using var cmd = new NpgsqlCommand("SELECT now();", conn);
    var result = await cmd.ExecuteScalarAsync();

    Console.WriteLine($"Job executed at {result}");
}

üí° Make sure you regenerate the token every time the job runs.
üõë Don't Do This:

    ‚ùå Don't store the token in configuration/environment variables.

    ‚ùå Don't reuse DbContext or NpgsqlConnection across executions when using IAM auth.

üõ°Ô∏è Extra Recommendation:

    You can disable connection pooling if you want to guarantee no stale connections:

    new NpgsqlConnectionStringBuilder(connString) { Pooling = false };

    But this impacts performance, so regenerating token + new connection per job is a better trade-off in background jobs.

Let me know if you're using EF Core ‚Äî the solution is slightly different in that case.
You said:
yes i want EF core based solution
ChatGPT said:

Great ‚Äî since you're using Entity Framework Core with IAM authentication for Aurora PostgreSQL, and IAM tokens expire every 15 minutes, the core issue remains the same: the EF Core DbContext is using a stale connection string with an expired token.

So, the EF Core solution must ensure that:

    Every time the job runs, a new IAM token is generated.

    A new DbContext is created using that token and not reused across job invocations.

‚úÖ EF Core ‚Äì Working Solution Pattern

Here‚Äôs how you can solve it properly:
1. Create a custom DbContextFactory that generates a fresh token each time:

using Amazon.RDS.Util;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Npgsql;

public class MyDbContextFactory
{
    private readonly string _dbHost = "your-db-host";
    private readonly int _dbPort = 5432;
    private readonly string _dbUser = "your-db-user";
    private readonly string _dbName = "your-db-name";
    private readonly string _region = "us-west-2";

    public MyDbContext CreateDbContext()
    {
        var token = RDSAuthTokenGenerator.GenerateAuthToken(
            region: _region,
            endpoint: _dbHost,
            port: _dbPort,
            username: _dbUser
        );

        var connString = new NpgsqlConnectionStringBuilder
        {
            Host = _dbHost,
            Port = _dbPort,
            Username = _dbUser,
            Password = token,
            Database = _dbName,
            SslMode = SslMode.Require,
            TrustServerCertificate = true,
            Pooling = false  // Optional: disable pooling to avoid reusing expired token
        }.ToString();

        var optionsBuilder = new DbContextOptionsBuilder<MyDbContext>();
        optionsBuilder.UseNpgsql(connString);

        return new MyDbContext(optionsBuilder.Options);
    }
}

2. Use the factory in your background job:

public class MyBackgroundJob
{
    private readonly MyDbContextFactory _dbContextFactory;

    public MyBackgroundJob(MyDbContextFactory dbContextFactory)
    {
        _dbContextFactory = dbContextFactory;
    }

    public async Task RunAsync()
    {
        using var dbContext = _dbContextFactory.CreateDbContext();

        var items = await dbContext.SomeTable.ToListAsync();
        Console.WriteLine($"Retrieved {items.Count} items at {DateTime.UtcNow}");
    }
}

üîÅ Token Rotation Notes

    Tokens last 15 minutes. So, even if you run a long-running job, you must not reuse the same DbContext beyond 15 minutes.

    You can also inject the factory using DI, but avoid singleton or scoped reuse across job triggers.

üõ†Ô∏è Optional Enhancements

    Add retry logic for expired token failures (e.g., retry with a fresh token on 28P01 or 28000 PostgreSQL auth errors).

    Consider metrics/logging to track token creation frequency and failures.

‚úÖ Prerequisites:

    Install NuGet packages:

dotnet add package Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL
dotnet add package AWSSDK.RDS

    Aurora PostgreSQL instance must have IAM auth enabled.

    Your ECS task must be using a task role with permission to generate the token (rds-db:connect).

Let me know if you'd like:

    A version that uses dependency injection for DbContext with a dynamic connection string

    A version that runs this job inside AWS Lambda

    Logging, error handling, or retry policies added

This version is ideal for ECS-based background processing.
