These simple bot will allow you to chat with PDF files. The locall LLM which these bots are going to use by default is https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GGUF/blob/main/llama-2-7b-chat.Q8_0.gguf.
This repo have two apps, you can run "allinone.py" through chainlit command if you would like to use GUI to upload the file and then chat with the document. "answerbot.py" is another implementation which will allow you ask question regarding multiple documents but you need to use "ingest.py" to perform the embedding process.
